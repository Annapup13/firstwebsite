      other characters, she compensates by making her time on screen meaningful. Played by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochitl_Gomez" target="_blank"> Xochitl Gomez </a>, America has the abiliity
      to travel through universes which is pretty awesome. In the comics she is also a member of the Young Avengers
      alongside Ms. Marvel, Loki, and few others. </h5>

  <div id="KamalaKhan">
    <h3>Kamala Khan</h3>
    <h5>In the MCU, Kamala is every MCU fan. She is obsessed with the Avengers but most especially Captain Marvel. In her tv show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBtLPf6Hy3E" target="_blank"> Ms. Marvel </a>
    she gains her powers through a bangle gifted to her by her grandmother. She will be seen again in The Marvels. </h5>

  <div id="Loki">
    <h3>Loki Laufeyson</h3>
    <h5>Played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hiddleston" target="_blank"> Tom Hiddleston</a>, Loki is an amazing and complex character. The first project he was in was Thor and his latest was in his own show. </h5>

  <div id="moon">
    <h3>Marc Spector, Steven Grant, and Jake Lockley</h3>

  <div id="Wanda">
    <h3>Wanda Maximoff</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen" target="_blank"> Elizabeth Olsen</a> plays a powrful witch with the power to quite litterally rewrite reality and all she chose to do was find a world where she can be happy. The thousands of dead bodies she left in her wake were, however, problematic.
      Wanda Maximoff's first apperance in the MCU was in 2014 in a post credit scene featured in Captain America the Winter Soldier. She has been featured in many other projects with her most recent being Doctor Strange in
      the Multiverse of Madness.  </h5>
